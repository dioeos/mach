# Mach

**M**acro **A**nd **C**ommand **H**elper is a lightweight, cross-platform Rust-powered application that lets you trigger an overlay via a global hotkey to display your user-defined macros and commands from a JSON file.

> [!WARNING]
> **Why MACH?** MACH exists for a simple reason: to stop you from constantly Googling or forgetting needed commands and macros.  
> Whether it's using a CLI command, executing some VS Code keybinding, or just running that one obscure script you can never remember, MACH keeps all your important commands and macros just one hotkey away...
